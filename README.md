This project generates RSS feeds for [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending) using GitHub Actions.

These actions run daily to create the feeds, which are then hosted on GitHub Pages. You can check their status [here](https://github.com/redreamality/GitHubTrendingRSS/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Fetch+and+Generate+RSS+Feeds%22).

Feeds for some popular programming languages, such as Python and JavaScript, have more details than others. If your favorite language is not included in [this list](https://github.com/redreamality/GitHubTrendingRSS/blob/master/Sources/GitHubTrendingRSSKit/Const.swift#L39), you can contribute by sending a pull request to add it. Alternatively, you can fork this repository and host your own feeds using GitHub Actions.
